  AOLServer 4.0r10 README
  Frank Bergmann <frank.bergmann@project-open.com>

  This README and aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2 are part of the ]project-open[ 
  Linux installer.
  This document describes the use of aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2.

  0. About the aolserver4.0r10


  AOLServer is the "application server" of ]project-open[, handling
  Web request, database pooling, overload behaviour etc.
  
  aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2 is a newer version and replaces aolserver3.3oacs.
  This file describes how to switch a server from aolserver3.3oacs
  to aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2.

  This file is NOT the ]project-open[ installer. It is just an add-on
  to deal with issues of aolserver3.3oacs.

  ______________________________________________________________________

  1. Prerequisits:

  - We asume that you are running a standard ]project-open[
    installation as after successfully installing the ]po[ Linux
    installer.
  
  - The aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2 file, to be downloaded from 
    www.SourceForge.net

  2. Installation Instructions


  It will probably take you 15 minutes to go through the following 
  steps:

	- Change directory to /usr/local/

	- Unpack the aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2:
		- bzip2 -d aolserver4.0r10.tar.bz2
		- tar xf aolserver4.0r10.tar
	  You should now have two "aolserver" directories in
	  /usr/local/ with the version numbers "3.3oacs" and "4.0r10".

	- Modify /web/projop/etc/config.tcl:
		- Replace any occurrence of "3.3oacs" by "4.0r10"
	  We assume that your server is named "projop". Please
	  replace with your respective servers.

	- Modify /etc/inittab:
		- Replace any occurrence of "3.3oacs" by "4.0r10"

  That's it. aolserver4.0r10 is upward compatible with aolserver3.3oacs
  with respect to ]project-open[

  3. Trouble Shooting
  
  - Please make sure to monitor the AOLServer log file. Any issues 
    can be found there: /web/projop/log/error.log. To monitor this
    file please open up a new window and issue the command: 
    "tail -f /web/projop/log/error.log"

  - Make sure that you don't start a new aolserver when there is still
    the old version running. Make sure that "aolserver/4.0.10"
    appears in your log files.

  - You can manually start aolserver by issuing:
    /usr/local/aolserver4.0r10/bin/nsd -f -t /web/projop/etc/config.tcl \
    -u projop -g projop (or similar, depending on your server name).
