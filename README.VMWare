  1. Overview

  This Virtual Machine represents a sample production configuration
  of ]project-open[. It consists of two "virtual" servers:

  - "projop" is the Production Server and
  - "stage" is the Staging Server

  The production server is used to run your company, while the staging
  server is used to test configuration and code updates. Please see the
  PO-Operations-Maintenance guide for details.
