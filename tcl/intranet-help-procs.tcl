<h1>Welcome to $projop</h1>
We have set up a sample system for you in order to show you how
a typical company could look like. 

Currently we are preparing some tutorial flash demos. Here's a first 
sample, expect more to come soon. 


Please follow the links to explore the (freely invented) sample contents.

You can use 'Admin' -&gt; 'Cleanup Demo Data' to remove the
demo data from this server and start using this server in production
if you are a small organization.<p>
