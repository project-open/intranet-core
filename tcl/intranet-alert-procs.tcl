    API for sending out email alerts for various Intranet functions

# Add an alert to the database alert queue

ad_proc im_send_alert {target_id frequency subject {message ""} } {
    Add a new alert to the queue for a specific user.
    The idea is to aggregate several alerts into a single email,
    to avoid hundereds or emails, for example if a user has been
    assigned a lot of tasks.
    So "subject" in not suposed to go into the subject of the message
    (except if there is a mail with a single alert), but as an
    intermediate header.
    The "message" is suposed to be plain text only. We are going to
    preserve line break, but we will add a "\t" before each line.
    "Frequency" can be one of: now (minutely), hourly, daily, weekly, 
    biweekly, monthly, trimesterly, semesterly, yearly.
