==============================================================
V4.1 Changes
==============================================================

]project-open[ V4.1 is mainly a bug fix release with gradual
improvements thanks to several large customer implantation
projects.


New Packages

- Mobile Timesheet Logging (experimental):
  A Sencha client for mobile devices (issues on Android?).

- Rule Engine:
  Allows you to define actions that are executed once a value
  of a project, a task or any other business object (future)
  changes or reaches a certain value.
  For example, a task reaching 100% could trigger a notification
  email to the project manager.

- CRM Opportunity Tracking:
  This package maintains a list of opportunities during the
  qualification and sales cycle (sales pipeline).

- Periodic Invoicing (experimental):
  This new package introduces the notion of a "service contract"
  with certain parameters including a monthly fee, a number of
  free service hours and the price per additional service hour.
  A (semi-) automatic invoicing functionality allows to process
  many service contracts in "batch mode".

- Events & Training Management:
  This new package is now running in production with one
  customer. It consists of a new business object "event"
  that handles resource allocation using a calendar view.



Important Features

- GUI:
  Added sub-menus to main tabs - still accepting comments

- Absences:
  Automatically maintaining groups per office in order to allow
  for bank holidays per office. These bank holidays enter into
  the resource management calculation algorithm.



New Experimental Functionality

- Cloud Backup:
  A new experimental feature allows you to perform backups
  from your on-premise Windows or Linux installation to a
  ]project-open[ backup server. In case of an accident we
  will offer you the option to "resurrect" your machine as
  a SaaS hosted machine within 24 hours.
  This is an experimental service. Please let us know if
  you are interested, in exchange of two years free service.
  We plan to price this "Cloud Backup" service at EUR 10
  per month with standard SaaS charges in case of a restore.

- Project Membership based on Groups:
  A new feature allows you to add groups as "members" to
  a project, company or other business object. This allows
  some customers to streamline permission assignment.

- Fast-Track Customer Contact Adding:
  We have included a new option to enter CRM customer
  contacts + companies including a duplicate check based
  of fuzzy full-text search.


Bugs Fixed

- Timesheet Approval Workflow
- Localization:
  Fixed various non-translatable strings
- Auto-Login:
  Fixed behaviour for automatic login from emails sent
  out by the forum and mailing functionalities.


Performance

- A large customer with 40.000 users served as a base
  for a number of performance enhancements that have
  become part of the product.


Small Stuff

- CRM Mass-Mailing functionality:
  You can now send thousands of personalized emails
  messages to customers of other groups.

- Helpdesk:
  Priority changes now send out better notifications mails.

- New reports:
  Which??

- Fixed Resource Management:
  - New report(?)

- Task Management:
  ]po[ now allows a user to delete a task in a project, if
  there are no financial items related to the task.

- Workflow Vacation Handling:
  Users can now specific their replacement when creating a
  new absence. The absence replacement has the right to
  process workflow approvals for the absent person during the
  vacation period.


Security

- A scurity testing company performed a one week testing on ]po[
  and found no major issue. However, there were several minor
  issues that were fixed in ]po[ V4.1:
  - Header Injection
  - Redirect
  - SQL injection in the category administration section.
    This bug would have been serious. However, the affected pages
    are only accessible to the system adminstrator who has the
    right to perform arbitrary SQL statements anyway.
  - "util_memoize" Issues:
    ]po[ contains a two-layered protection against SQL injection
    attacks. Issues in the use of util_memoize broke the database
    layer in several pages. However, the second "ad_page_contract"
    layer prevented actual exploits.

- Improved IDS (Intrusion Detection System):
  ]po[ now includes a series of "sensors" and an integrated
  reporting functionality to detect unusual activities in the
  system.



==============================================================
V4.0 Changes
==============================================================


Incompatible Changes

]po[ V4.0 requires new versions of OpenACS, AOLserver and PostgreSQL,
so customers with AOLserver 3.3.x or PostgreSQL 8.1 or below will have
to update their entire installation. This is the reason for the change
in the "major" release number to V4.0. These changes are justified by
several main improvements:

      * New "XoWiki":
	XoWiki is a full Media Wiki implementation integrated with the
	rest of ]po[.

      * AJAX Support:
	The new OpenACS version (5.7) includes support for a number of
	AJAX libraries. AJAX support is going to become progressively
	more important.


Major Enhancements & New Packages

      * MS-Project Round-Trip Integration:
      	V4.0 allows you to start your project in ]po[, import a project
	schedule from MS-Project, continue to edit information in ]po[,
	export the results to MS-Project for further editing, import the
	results and so on.

      *	LDAP and Active Directory Integration:
      	V4.0 includes a configuration wizard that guides usres through the
      	process of setting up an integration with Active Directory.

      * System Configurator:
	A new configurator allows to export a ]po[ configuration into CSV
	(Excel) format and to apply the configuration to a new server. This
	configurator allows us to define several "verticals" for ]po[ with
	very specific configuration, effectively reducing the effort
	necessary to adapt ]po[ to a user's needs.

      * Project Baselines (Enteprise Edition):
      	This package package stores "versions" of a project and allows
	users to compare the current project plan to previous plans.
	The pac	kage depends on the Audit commercial package and may
	become part of the ]po[ "enterprise" version.

      *	Financial Planning (Enterprise Edition):
      	The package allows for financial/cashflow/budget planning per
	project phase, project member, cost type and date (month, quarter,
	year). Planned values are integrated into the project's financial
	summary.

      * Project Portfolio Management:
      	]po[ now allows to define define portfolios of projects and
	includes a number of reports and indicators in order to track
	portfolios.
	The package also contains "what-if" scenarios to analyze the impact
	of adding additional projects or changing project priorities.

      * Project Risk Management:
      	This package allows to manage a risk plan per project. A graphical
	indicators shows summarized risks.

      * Sharepoint Integration:
      	The package links ]po[ projects to a Sharepoint server for storing
	documents.

      * Mail Tracking:
      	A CRM package capable of associating incoming and outgoing mails
	with users and projects.

      *	Funambol integration ( Outlook and mobile devices):
      	The Linux version of ]po[ V4.0 will include an experimental
	Funambol integration. Funambol  is a SyncMS server allowing to
	synchronize tasks and calendar items across mobile devices and
	PIM software including MS-Outlook. We expect to improve this
	integration during the course of the V4.0 lifecycle.

      *	SLA Management and improved Helpdesk:
      	A ITSM package that provides "SLA Parameters" to capture
	contractual rules defined in SLAs and a component for SLA working
	hours. Indicators automatically track the value of SLA parameters,
	warning managers if defined SLA levels are close to be violated.

      * CVS Integration:
      	This ITSM package allows to import CVS commits into ]po[,
      	automatically associating commits with projects.
	The package also allows to generate CVS+ACL configuration files,
	effectively allowing to maintain CVS permission configuration in
	]po[.


New Features:

      * AJAX Date-Pickers for all important forms:
      	All important forms in ]po[ now include an AJAX date picket widget
	in order to avoid editing dates in a Web 1.0 type of widget.
	Reports and similar pages still don't have a date picker, because
	most users seem to be fine with a YYYY-MM-DD input.

      * Expense Management:
      	Allows adding notes in multi-expense forms. We have also added two
	additional reports.

      * Extended HTTPS Support:
      	You can now wonfigure which pages can only be accessed through
	HTTPS.

      * Resource Management:
      	We have added a new New Resource Planning Report.

      * Exchange rates:
      	]project-open[ can now be configured to get updated exchange rates
      	automatically.

      * Invoices:
      	OpenOffice "Writer" Export: Invoices can now be exported in
	"Writer" format. In the future we might also add a Writer to PDF
	converter in order to create PDF.

      *	Grouped invoice items:
      	Create an invoice for a main project that contains grouped &
	accumulated invoice elements of positions from sub-projects
	Invoice elements are now related to time sheet tasks.

      *	Translation:
      	* Invoices can now have Discount/Surcharge Lines
	* A "Customer Portal" allows customers to request a quote and get
	  access to their financial documents.
	* Bulk edit of translation tasks is now possible

      * Admin:
      	Admin -> User Profiles now allows to filter privileges by keyword.


==============================================================
V3.5 Changes
==============================================================


Major Enhancements & New Packages

      * REST Interface:
	The REST Web-Services server is now available in version
	V1.5.1 with includes a number of bug fixes. The fixes are
	due to active development of several new REST clients:
	PO-Timesheet  is a REST Java client implementing timesheet
	management. A Perl REST client is available in
	/intranet-rest/perl-client-examples/ showing access to ]po[
	projects. ]po[ partner Winzentis is developing an iPhone App
	using the REST interface.

      * Resource Management Package:
	This package currently contains only a single resource report
	which replaces the V3.4 /intranet-ganttproject/gant-resources-cube.
	The new report:
	* fixes a bug of the older report (related to the maximum
	  length of the URL),
	* provides better performance (now allows for hundreds of
	  projects and users) and
	* integrates absences into the display.

Bug Fixes

V3.5 is mainly a bug-fix release of V3.4, so literally hundreds
of fixes have been applied.


==============================================================
V3.4 Changes
==============================================================

Major Enhancements & New Packages

      * GUI Improvements:
	We have completely restructured the GUI based on CSS "skins".

      * Performance Improvements for large Organizations:
	We have implemented optimizations to improve performance for
	organizations with >1000 users: Caching mechanisms (speedup
	x3 on a number of frequently used pages), SQL optimizations
	(speedup x10 on some reports, x2 speedups on other pages) and
	improved support for parallelization on multi-core processors).

      * Integration of Dynamic Workflow:
	The Petri-Net Workflow was already part of V3.2. In V3.4 we
	have extended the number of objects to which you can attach
	a workflow and we provide default workflows for budgets,
	projects, absences and timesheets.

      * Reporting: Added user-definable reports
      * Reporting: Added an "Indicators" module that allows
	to define and track process performance indicators over time.
      * Invoices: "Canned Notes" implement pre-defined statements

	to improve performance.
      * Rating: Added "Simple Surveys" rating module
      * CRM: Improved the "intranet-mail-integration" Email
	integration module so that it is now usable. The module allows to
	associate incoming email with ]po[ users, effectively maintaining
	an email track record per customer.
      * Translation: Added a link for "editors" to rate their
	"translator" (translation-only)
      * Translation: Added a "Tandem Translation Module". This
	module keeps track of the translator-editor tandem combination by
	counting how frequently an editor has worked with a translator.

        senior executives, to priorize projects in a portfolio etc.

      * Project Templates:
        Project templates (creating new projects based on an existing
        project template) allows you to standardize and accelerate the
        generation of projects with similar schedules.

      * Dynamic Fields for Project, Companies and Users:
	We have greatly extended the "DynField" module to include DynFields
	in reports and CVS exports. Also, DynFields are now specific to
	object subtypes (for example: Type of projects).

      * New "Delivery Note" Financial Document Type
	Delivery notes are a step before issuing an invoice.




New Commercial "Enterprise Extension Modules":

The following modules are closed-source extensions of ]po[ covering the needs
of large organizations. These modules are available separately from the ]po[
product at http://www.project-open.com/shop/.

	counter) is still the default.
      * "Create Company from User" wizard speeds up the creation
	of new users and their companies


]project-translation[ Specific Enhancements:

      * Added a "Aggregrate" checkbox in the translation invoice wizard.
	Unchecking this checkbox allows to create quotes and invoices with
	details (delivery date) of the individual translation tasks.

	forcing people to log a certain amount of hours per week.
	Added a parameter that specifies the number of hours to be logged.
	Added a parameter to redirect from "Home", "Projects" or both.
      * Financial documents can be sent as HTML attachments.
      * Automatic advancement of the "percent completed" filed in a project,
	depending on the state of both consulting and translation tasks
	the Translation Workflow Status
      * Added date and currency format localization in the InvoiceViewPage.
	The locale is taken from the invoice template and allows to create
	correctly localized
      * Enabled alphabetical sorting of projects in the timesheet page
	(this was quite difficult because of the hierarchical SQL query
	that includes subprojects and their tasks..)
      * Added "Nuke Demo Companies" option to cleanup selected "companies"
	when taking the system productively
      * "Search" field now clears up when clicking on it (if Full-Text
	Search is installed)

	of privileges determines the default permissions, instead of the
	either very permissive or restictive settings before.
      * Added Windows-to-Linus and Linux-to-Windows conversion of parameters.
	This function allows users to migrate database backup dumps easier
	between a Linux version (production?) and a Windows version
	(testing, development?)
      * Allowing to accept/reject multiple tasks of intranet-forum on the
	home page. This makes it much quicker to deal with large amounts

	package
      * Fixed pagination in Translation ProjectListPage
      * Added several reports to intranet-reporting

	circumstances.
      * Fixed the Company's financial documents "more info..." link
      * Fixed roject's "Profit & Loss" view in the "Tigerpond" demo systems.
	This view was not enabled by default.
      * Fixed URLs in automatic alert emails: Outlooks breaks the lines

	now to avoid this situation (unless you've got a very long hostname...)
      * Fixed ugly JavaScript error if Full-Text Search is not installed
      * Fixed a few issues with "Nuke Demo Data". Includes the situation
	that a user has become manager of a cost center.
      * Fixed "Advanced Filtering" in the ProjectListPage
      * Relaxed security permissions for project budgets.
	Now the "view_budget" privilege controls the visibility, instead
	of the (usually tighter) "view_finance"
      * Fixed bug in sending out multipart emails if the Subject includes a
	newline character.




==============================================================
V3.1.1.0 Changes
==============================================================

V3.1.1.0 includes some 80 enhancements, resolved issues, and resolved
inconsistencies, compared with V3.0.0.6:

Major Enhancements

      * "Delete Demo Data": This functionality in the "Admin" section allows

	a ]po[ demo configuration (Tigerpond company), to delete any existing
	projects, users, ... and to use this system to start production use
	for your company.

	needs to be enhanced to include an automatic update of the currency
	conversion table.
      * A new Reporting Module is now available available as a closed-source
	extension module. The module currently includes only three major
	reports
