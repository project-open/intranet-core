  ]project-open[ V5.0 Virtual Machine
  Community Edition, 2015-11-30


  ______________________________________________________________________

  1. ]po[ Distribution and Included Software

  In legal terms, the ]project-open[ product consists of about
  150 separately installable and uninstallable software "packages"
  produced and maintained by Project Open Business Software S.L in
  Barcelona, Spain. Packages are individually installable units
  of code as defined by the OpenACS community system.

  In order to provide project management functionality, these
  150 packages require a rather complex base of about 100 different
  open-source projects in specific versions and configurations.
  For this reason, we provide a "Windows Installer" and a "Linux
  VMware" with suitable configured infrastructure, in addition to
  the "Upgrade Installer" with the main ]po[ code and some Web
  libraries.

  We consider the Windows and Linux installers as mere aggregations
  of software in the sense of the GNU Public License V2
  ("distributions"). For this reason you will have to agree with the
  individual license terms and conditions of each of the software
  products included.

  You need to agree with the license terms of ALL of these packages
  before using or otherwise interacting with the software.

  Open Source
  
  "Open Source" software - software available without charge for use, 
  modification and distribution - is often licensed under terms that require 
  the user to make the user's modifications to the Open Source software or 
  any software that the user 'combines' with the Open Source software freely 
  available in source code form. If you use Open Source software in conjunction
  with the programs, you must ensure that your use does not: (i) create, or 
  purport to create, obligations of us with respect to the ]project-open[ 
  programs; or (ii) grant, or purport to grant, to any third party any rights 
  to or immunities under our intellectual property or proprietary rights in 
  the ]project-open[ programs. For example, you may not develop a software 
  program using an ]project-open[ program and an Open Source program where 
  such use results in a program file(s) that contains code from both the 
  ]project-open[ program and the Open Source program (including without 
  limitation libraries) if the Open Source program is licensed under a 
  license that requires any "modifications" be made freely available. You 
  also may not combine the ]project-open[ program with programs licensed 
  under the GNU General Public License ("GPL") in any manner that could 
  cause, or could be interpreted or asserted to cause, the ]project-open[ 
  program or any modifications thereto to become subject to the terms of the 
  GPL.
  
  Entire Agreement
  
  You agree that this agreement is the complete agreement for the programs 
  and licenses, and this agreement supersedes all prior or contemporaneous 
  agreements or representations. If any term of this agreement is found to 
  be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will remain effective.
