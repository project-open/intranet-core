  Community Edition, 2017-10-30

  This is the ]project-open[ Virtual Machine. This document describes
  the installation and configuration of the VMware appliance.

  ______________________________________________________________________

  1. Quick Start

  This VMware appliance includes a fully configured ]project-open[
  server in VMware Workstation format.

  - You need VMware Workstation Player 12 or Player 7 (free personal 
    license available) or higher to execute the VM.

  - As an alternative, you can use VMware ESXi 5 (free license 
    available) or higher after converting the VM using VMware vCenter 
    Converter or similar.

  - Now start the virtual machine. Please login using:

        **********************
	Username:	projop
	Password:	projop
        **********************

    "projop" is also the default password for the KDE Wallet inside
    the VMware.
    As an alternative, you can enter as root with password "root".
    Please change these passwords before using the VMware in a 
    production environment.

  - Please click on the "]project-open[" icon at the Linux desktop.
    A browser should open with the first page of ]project-open[.
    Please login as "System Administrator":
    
	Email:		sysadmin@tigerpond.com
	Password:	system

  - Please follow the System Configuration Wizard to creeate a basic
    configuration for your business. Don't worry too much about the
    answers, you can repeat this step later at any time.

  with the license terms of ALL packages before using or otherwise
  interacting with the software.


  ______________________________________________________________________

  3. Prerequisites

  In order to run this ]project-open[ for testing purposes you need at 
  least:

  - A computer with Windows 7 or higher for VMware Workstation,
    Player, or a ESXi server.
  - At least 1 core of a recent AMD or Intel processor
  - At least 1 GB RAM
  - At least 50 GB of free disk space

  For a production system with up to 10 "active users" we recommend:

  - A ESXi server,
  - At least 4 cores of a recent AMD or Intel processor
  - 8 GB RAM
  - 200 GB of fast disk space with >5k IOPS.
    A standard RAID 5 will cause performance problems.

  For larger installations please contact the ]po[ team

  6. Configure the VMware's IP Address

  You will need to determine the IP address for the appliance
  if you want to access ]po[ from your LAN or Intranet.

  To find out the IP address, double-click the "]po[ @ Localhost" icon
  in the VMware's desktop. The ]po[ login page includes a status section 
  in the lower part of the browser:

  - Browser URL:	http://192.168.0.101/	(sample value)
  - IP Address:		192.168.0.101		(sample value)
  - Total Memory:	512 MByte		(sample value)

  Now open a Web browser on your computer or another computer and enter 
  http://192.168.0.101/ (sample value, as above). 
  You should now get the same page as from inside the VMware.


  Troubleshooting:

  If you don't see the IP Address as above, you will need to check at
  the network configuration of your VMware and your LAN environment:

  1) Did you enable the Network Adapter in your VMware?
     Please right-click on the "Network Adapter" icon at the bottom of
     your VMware console.

     => Please make sure the Network Adapter is "connected".
        The text of the status is a bit misleading I think, you need
        to read the word "Disconnect"...
     => Please make sure the Network Adapter modus is set to "Bridged". 
        Only a bridged setting will allow external computers to connect 
        to your VMware.

     You will have to refresh the Linux network settings once you have 
     modified/enabled your Network Adapter. Please go to:
     System -> Administration -> Network
     ("System" is located in the left bottom corner of in the tray of the
     VMware appliance, beside "Applications" and "Places")
     Then please "Activate" the "eth0" interface. 

  2) Please make sure there is a DHCP server available in your LAN.
     Otherwise please configure a fixed IP address using 
     System -> Administration -> Network.

  3) Please check the "Network Manager" icon in the task bar of the Linux
     guest operating system. The Network Manager allows you to configure
     your Linux network settings. Please check the Internet for instructions.
     
  3) Still not resolved? Then please have a look at
     www.project-open.com/en/install-vm and
     www.sourceforge.net/projects/project-open -> OpenDiscussion for
     issues similar to yours. Please ask a new message ONLY after searching
     for a solution.

  7. Basic configuration of ]project-open[


  In order to configure the VMware, please login as:

	Email:		sysadmin@tigerpond.com
	Password:	system


  You will now see the System Configuration Wizard that guides
  you through the configuration of the ]project-open[ System.
  The purpose of the wizard is to simplify the system by disabling 
  unnecessary functionality.
  But don't worry too much about your answers, you can repeat this 
  step at any time.

  For a maximum configuration please choose the "Other / Everything,"
  "Complete / Full Installation" and "Three Hierarchical Levels"
  options at the bottom of each wizard page.

  After restarting the server (last step of the configurtion) you can
  go back to the "Home" tab. You will find a nicely preconfigured ]po[ 
  server with demo data.

  On the "Home" page you will find the "Interactive Administration
  Guide" with a number of additional configuration tasks.
