3. Installation Overview

The installation procedure consists of the following steps

	1. Check the the prerequisites are OK
	1. Setup of AOLServer. AOLServer is a webserver,
	   similar to Apache.




4. Installation Procedure Overview

4.1. Install AOLServer

AOLServer is the application server of ]project-open[. It is similar
to Apache, but includes a built-in compiler for the language "TCL".
AOLServer is _the_ server of AOL and is know to deliver up to 
2.5 Million pages/second.

# cd /usr/local/
# tar xzf aolserver3.3oacs.tgz 

Check that AOLServer is working:

# /usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd -h
=> ....


4.1. Install ]project-open[ and OpenACS Source

The default location for ]project-open[ is /web/. This is handy if
you have several servers and if the main purpose of your computer
is to run web servers. You can use a different directory, but you'll
have to change pathes in the config.tcl and later in the application
configuration. So we RECOMMEND that you stick with /web/, atleast for 
the first installation.

# cd /
# mkdir /web
# cd /web
# tar xzf po31.3-1-0-0-1.tgz



4.2. Create a new User and Group

]project-open[ should be run via its own user and group by default.
Both the user and the group should have the same name as the directory
and the "server" name (see config file below):

# groupadd po31
# useradd -g po31 -d /web/po31 po31



4.3. Verify the Config File

The config.tcl config file in /web/po31/etc/ tells AOLServer where to 
start action. Please verify the first 10 or so lines to for IP address, 
port etc. 
Here are the sample values that are delivered with the installer:


	#------------------------------------------------------
	# change to 80 and 443 for production use
	set httpport                  8080
	set httpsport                 8443
	
	# The name of the server and its location
	set server                    "po31"
	set servername                "ProjectOpen Test Server"
	
	# The hostname and address should be set to actual values.
	set hostname                  [ns_info hostname]
	set address                   "0.0.0.0"



4.4. Set Permissions and Owner

All files in /web/po31/ should be owned by po31:

# cd /web
# chmod -R po31:po31 po31



4.5. Setup the PostgreSQL Database

We are going to create a database "po31" and load a preconfigured demo
system into this database:

Check that PostgreSQL is up and running

# su - postgres
# psql --help
=> ...

Create a new user. The new user should be a database admin (-a, -d)
because these privileges are needed in order to setup the full-text
search engine:

#postgres:~> createuser -a -d po31

Create a new database:

#postgres:~> createdb --owner=po31 po31

Create the database language:

#postgres:~> createlang plpgsql po31
=> May say that "plpgsql" is already installed




4.6. Load the Demo Data into the Database

There are two demo configurations coming with this server:

- ]project-consulting[ is a small consulting company with
  some 10 employees. This setup is also suitable for 
  advertising agencies, engineering offices, IT departments
  of larger companies etc.


- ]project-translation[ is a small translation company with
  some 10 employees. This setup is also suitable for
  localization companies and translation departments of
  larger companies.


#su - po31
#po31:~> psql -f pocons.3-1-0-0-1.preconf.sql (]project-consulting[)

or 

#po31:~> psql -f potrans.3-1-0-0-1.preconf.sql (]project-translation[)




4.5. Test the server

Now we are ready to start the server. We are going to run it in
"foreground mode" to get all debugging messages on the terminal.
(The "\" indicates a continuation of the same line):

# /usr/local/aolserver3.3oacs/bin/nsd -f -t /web/po31/etc/config.tcl \
  -u po31 -g po31
=> You should get hundereds of lines of debugging output.


Please check the output for first occurrence of an "error:" string.
]po[ gives quite detailed error messages that allow you track down
any error.
However, if everything goes well you should see a line like this
after ~1 minute:


[...][...][...]	Notice: nssock: listening on 0.0.0.0:8080

Congratulations!

The rest of these instructions it to solidify the installation.
